# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  I struggled with the syntax clean up at first. I had to read through the lesson content again in order to get the hang of it. I also struggled with the last challenge in hashes_2.rb. It was hard for me to work through and it took me quite some time, but I learned in the process, so I would say it was a productive struggle. In my if statement, I learned that it wasn't neccessary for me to tell ruby that I wanted status to evaluate to true. Ruby was already doing that because the value was a boolean! Having that knowledge enabled me to write cleaner looking code! Cool!
 ``` ruby
 login_statuses.each do |name, status|
  if status 
    p "#{name}"
  end
end
```
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
 Note taking is going really well. I have always struggled with taking clear and helpful notes in the past, but it seems as though I am getting the hang of that as well. I find myself referencing my notes with confidence! I take my most effecient notes when I am going through the lessons on my own. I got myself a set of highlighters, and the use of them is great for making important information stand out to me!

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
 I often find myself trying to solve a problem on my own first, and then googling if the answer isn't very apparent to me. Not wasting too much time on trying to figure it out on my own is helpful. Time is going to be tight moving forward, and I think I have a nice balance of thinking about the problem, but also utilizing google as a helpful tool.
